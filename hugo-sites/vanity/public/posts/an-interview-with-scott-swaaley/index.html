<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-swaaley-p-e-1929519/">Scott Swaaley</a>  is one of the High Tech High teachers in the film  <a href="https://teddintersmith.com/mltsfilm/">Most Likely To Succeed</a> , from Ted Dintersmith. As I finished Dintersmith’s book:  <a href="https://teddintersmith.com/what-school-could-be/">“What School Could Be”</a> , this week I was reminded of when my colleague  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajohnmarshall/">John Marshall</a>  and I  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/teaching-as-a-rational-career-choice-scott-swaaley/id970661754?i=1000442655440">interviewed</a>  Scott a few years back.</p>
<p>We first met Scott through our colleague, Riverpoint Academy’s founding teacher,  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/regandrew/">Regan Drew</a> . Regan and Scott are  <a href="https://allendistinguishededucators.org/ADE-Awardees.aspx">Allen Distinguished Educators,</a>  and their collaboration brought Scott to RA. It was amazing to have the chance to see our school through his eyes and talk shop — the literal and metaphorical kind.</p>
<p>Scott embodies the “Do Better Things” idea of what school could be that Dintersmith is advocating for in “What School Could Be.” Scott is a creative tinkerer and iterative thinker. He is the Founder and CEO of  <a href="https://www.makesafetools.com/">MAKESafe Tools</a> , makers of the universal power tool brake. I had the chance to test an early prototype, it’s rad.
As you’ll hear in our interview, Scott’s passion, candor and enthusiasm are contagious. John and I had the chance to talk with Scott about all sorts of logistical, practical and philosophical components of teaching in a project-based learning environment. We recorded our conversation with Scott over four years ago, but we think it still holds up. Will you take a  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/teaching-as-a-rational-career-choice-scott-swaaley/id970661754?i=1000442655440">listen</a> ?</p>
