### **Learner** //
I’m curious polymath. I love exploring 🧮 mathematics with others, 🎨 ⌨️ creative coding, rhetoric, functional programming, interpersonal communication, football coaching philosophy, and 🎮 ✈️ RC Airplanes. **📚 Reading:** [Coders](https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Making-Tribe-Remaking-World/dp/0735220565) / [Range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=range+book&qid=1561313616&s=books&sr=1-1) / [The Design and Analysis Of Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Design-Analysis-Algorithms-3rd/dp/0132316811/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497736280&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=the+design+and+analysis+of+algorithms+annoy+levitin) / [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) / [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/) / [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/). **💡 Inspired by:** [Seymour Papert](http://www.papert.org/) / [Charley Harper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_Harper) / [Gever Tulley](https://www.instagram.com/gevertulley/?hl=en) / [Bees & Bombs](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) / [Daniel Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) / [Saskia Freeke](https://twitter.com/sasj_nl?lang=en) / [FliteTest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9zTuyWffK9ckEz1216noAw) / [my family](https://www.flickr.com/photos/greenhouse09). I’m deeply interested in the intersection of mathematical thinking and Computer Science. I’ve 👨🏻‍🏫 presented on this [topic.](https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?v=1968)


### **Maker** //
I like to 🥽 tinker. Here are a few of my favorite maker projects:
- A ☕️ [Coffee Table Arcade](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0dGrq0zwGPVNZ8)
- An interactive 👨🏻‍🎨 🖥 art [collaboration](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B17GRMtznG7tw9F) called Pascal’s Dots (w/ Taylor, Lexi and Anna) [Code](https://github.com/matthewalangreen/pascals-dots)
- A giant ꩜ [Spirograph](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0dGdIshaG7QBbH) (w/ my friend [Carl Richardson.](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2011/jun/02/beyond-words/))
- [Code](https://github.com/matthewalangreen/kinect-axidraw) to use a [Kinect](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-360-Kinect-Sensor-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B005GA1H4C) to control an [AxiDraw](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/846) 🖋 plotter.
- An 🎮 ✈️ RC Airplane 📈 datalogger custom circuit using [Adafruit Feather M0](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger/overview), [Altimeter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1893), & [Airspeed Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Hobbypower-Airspeed-MPXV7002DP-Differential-controller/dp/B00WSFWO36). [Pictures](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0d5ejO17etcfn) / [Arduino](https://github.com/riverpointacademy/Arduino/tree/master/RCDataLogger/rcDataLogger-v5) / [Wolfram Language](https://github.com/matt-green-ra/rcDataLogger).


### **Developer** //
I love algorithms and getting lost exploring why they work. I’m a creative coder, 👨🏻‍💻 iOS developer, and aspiring 👨🏻‍🎨 artist. I ♥️ [Project Euler,](http://projecteuler.net/) I enjoy writing Swift and Wolfram Language code. But truth be told, my heart will always belong to [Processing](http://processing.org/). SRSLY, So. Much. Fun. I worked with high school students to build [pincushion](https://github.com/riverpointacademy/pincushion)  – a native iOS app to manage 👰🏽 dress fittings and alterations contracts for the wedding industry. Lately I've been playing with 👨🏻‍🔬 🐍[Python and Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/matthewalangreen/jupyter/blob/master/Project_Euler/ProjectEuler32.ipynb). Mathematica is rad, but pretty 💵 [expensive.](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/home-hobby/)


### **Educator** //
This is what I was created to do. I’ve had the opportunity to work with 🏫 high school students across many disciplines, and am convinced that meaningful learning is most probable in a 🧶🥽 ✍🏻 project-based context. I’m a reformed behaviorist who fell in love with 👷🏻‍♂️🏗[Constructionsim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)) 🤔 😤 🤩 Struggle is essential to learning, as are 👍🏼 ☑️ quality tasks. My ❤️ passion for learning is fueled by the opportunity to ✍🏻 🔈share it with others. I’m a multi-paradigm educator adept at 🎨 designing & managing student projects, 🧭 guiding student exploration, 👨🏻‍🏫 lecturing effectively, facilitating 🧐 Socratic Seminars and ✍🏻 Writer’s Workshops. My six years learning & teaching @ [Riverpoint Academy](http://twitter.com/riverptacademy) gave me deep experience with 🥽 Maker learning, Human-centered 👋🏻 design, and the significance of centering on  ☺️ empathy in education.


### **Consultant** //
I've contracted with 🎨 🧶 🥽 [Gizmo](https://www.gizmo-cda.org/) this school year. I'm 💬 "co-thinking" with North Idaho teachers to design and support [21st Century classrooms](https://www.gizmo-cda.org/innovative-education.html). I ✍🏻 [write](https://medium.com/@matthewalangreen) about the work.

Gizmo shares my convictions:
- Humans must 🎨 🧶 🥽 make in order to 💡 🎓 learn
- Teachers need permission to 😔 fail, 💪🏻 iterate, and 🤩 improve before they can offer this to their students

I'm looking for 🤔🧐🙂 collaborators and I'm currently 📑 [accepting contracts](http://ce-consulting.co) for 👋🏻 in-person & 🖥 remote professional development, 🧭 training, & 🎨 instructional design. ✉️ [Contact me](mailto:matt@ce-consulting.co) for more information & booking enquiries.
